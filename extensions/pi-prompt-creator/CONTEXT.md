# pi-prompt-creator — Context

## Domain

Turn repetition and correction in the current Pi conversation into one editable prompt template candidate. The user decides whether the candidate becomes a global Pi prompt.

## Glossary

- **Current Conversation**: The active conversation branch, including summaries that replace compacted history. Inactive branches are outside the scope.
- **Signal**: Evidence in the Current Conversation that a reusable prompt may help. Signals are explicit recurrence language, repetition of the same underlying request, or repeated correction of the agent's behavior.
- **Prompt Candidate**: One unsaved, editable prompt template proposed from the strongest Signal. A session has at most one pending Prompt Candidate; the user may explicitly request another after the pending candidate is shown or dismissed.
- **Prompt Review**: Conversational refinement of a Prompt Candidate by the user and Main.
- **Final Prompt Draft**: Complete prompt-template Markdown authored by Main after Prompt Review. A Prompt Candidate is not a Final Prompt Draft.
- **Approved Prompt**: A Final Prompt Draft the user explicitly accepts for creation as a global Pi prompt. Approval never authorizes replacing an existing prompt.

## Boundary

| Concern | Home |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-session evidence and historical search | `@henryqw/pi-session-recall` |
| Scripts, Skills, and other automation | Their owning package or repository |
| This extension | Current-conversation Signal detection, Prompt Candidate generation, and Prompt Review |

The extension stays silent when it finds no Prompt Candidate. Background analysis remains visible while it is running. Manually requested candidates display when ready; automatic candidates wait for explicit user display, so background work never steals editor focus.
