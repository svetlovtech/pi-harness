# Route `/pr` by current condition

## Decision

`/pr` is one argument-free PR workflow router. It is not a browser opener, workflow menu, or family of action commands. Each invocation reads fresh remote and local state, derives one `PR next step`, runs at most one route, and stops. The footer and widget use the same priority for presentation, but fresh command state is authoritative. Direct merging happens only after final confirmation and a fresh readiness check.

A configured push target remains the direct discovery authority. When it is absent, discovery enumerates validated remotes for the same branch ref. One exact open PR with the advertised remote OID becomes an inferred target for presentation. `/pr` names the exact `remote/ref`, asks for confirmation, revalidates all authority, then links the branch. Inferred authority never permits update, sweep, CI-fix, or merge mutations.

Creation is selected only when no validated remote publishes the same ref, `origin` resolves to one safe GitHub destination, and Git push configuration can safely acquire that target. Ambiguous remotes or PRs, OID mismatch, unsafe link configuration, and a published ref without a PR are explicit blockers. For an existing configured pull request, the first matching condition wins:

1. Merged, closed, or draft: no action.
2. Required base update or merge conflict: run branch update only when the tree is clean and local HEAD equals the PR head. Otherwise, stop with no action.
3. CI failure: run CI fix under the same local prerequisite. Otherwise, stop with no action.
4. Changes requested or unresolved review threads: run comment sweep under the same local prerequisite. Otherwise, stop with no action.
5. Running CI, pending review, blocked merge policy, or unsafe local merge state: no action.
6. Merge-ready: allow a clean local HEAD equal to or behind the PR head. Ask for final confirmation, then squash-merge directly.

Ordinary conversation comments neither select a route nor block merging. Only changes requested and unresolved review threads count as blocking PR feedback. Draft presentation outranks running CI.

Current-branch discovery reads the validated head repository ref's GraphQL `associatedPullRequests` connection, without filtering by OID. This avoids global issue search, where valid branch-only queries can exceed GitHub's 1,000-result limit and owner-qualified `head:` values do not work. Discovery then validates every candidate URL, repository, ref, and OID. This makes a moved or mismatched PR head visible as a blocker instead of incorrectly appearing absent. It preserves the sole validated push URL as fetch authority, separate from repository identity. Without an open PR, one historical candidate must match the remote OID. Discovery never falls back to local HEAD when the remote ref is absent.

Confirmed linking snapshots existing upstream configuration and the remote-tracking ref. It fetches the exact inferred ref, sets upstream, and verifies that configured discovery resolves the same PR identity and OID. Any final failure rolls back only state still matching the extension's own writes; a concurrent change causes a visible incomplete-rollback failure instead of being overwritten.

When creation is selected, the bundled workflow honors an existing configured push target. It repeats remote-ref, PR, destination, and configuration checks immediately before mutation. It pushes a captured OID to the saved validated URL and exact ref with an exact saved-OID lease after proving an existing ref is its ancestor. Without a target, it uses the validated `origin` and local branch ref with an empty force-with-lease expectation, which atomically fails if the ref appeared concurrently, then sets upstream. The extension, not the creation skill, owns post-discovery Herdr labeling.

## Boundaries

Presentation polling never starts a workflow or auto-triages comments. Sessions outside a Git worktree emit no PR error or polling traffic. Other refresh failures expose a generic unavailable status rather than raw subprocess details. The router does not open a browser, invoke `/done` or `/sweep`, enable auto-merge or a merge queue, rebase the local branch, force-push, delete branches, or clean up worktrees. A single invocation never chains into another route.

Presentation and merge safety fetch the exact advertised PR head OID from the validated push URL. Fetches use `--no-write-fetch-head` and never read `FETCH_HEAD`. Merge safety resolves Git operation-state paths through Git, so linked worktrees also block in-progress merge, rebase, cherry-pick, revert, and sequencer operations. A pull request that GitHub reports as behind requires a base update. Passive refresh does not read branch protection, repository rulesets, or merge-method settings. Direct merge always requests squash, and GitHub rejects the mutation when repository policy does not allow it.

Branch update derives the exact base host and repository from the validated public PR URL. It uses supported public base ref and OID fields. The comment sweep resolves its helper and references from the effective package skill path. It needs no external `jq` executable. Before pushing, it revalidates the configured destination, full PR identity, and local HEAD. It pushes the captured OID once without fallback. A PR head already equal to local HEAD needs no push. Snapshot head equality remains required when a push is still needed. Each PR hostname selects its GitHub API host. Only authenticated GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise repositories are supported.

## Consequences

The public interaction stays small: one command shows or runs the current highest-priority next step. Missing configuration no longer implies absence, so creation cannot silently duplicate an existing published PR. Linking adds one explicit confirmation and rollback path. The footer and widget can briefly lag between 30-second refreshes, while `/pr` avoids acting on that stale presentation. Exact-base, non-rewriting branch updates and confirmed direct merges keep mutations bounded and observable.
